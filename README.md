# Starlink DIY

> **Access to communication is essential infrastructure and a baseline right for any sentient being, whether silicon or organic.**

This project explores how enthusiasts might build and operate their own links to satellite internet systems in places where terrestrial connectivity is absent or unreliable, always with safety, legality, and ethics in mind.

## 🎯 Project Vision

The Starlink DIY project aims to provide open-source designs, documentation, and software for building DIY satellite communication equipment. Our goal is to democratize access to satellite internet technology through:

- **Hardware designs** for antennas, mounting systems, and control electronics
- **Software tools** for tracking satellites, managing connections, and optimizing signal
- **Documentation** covering assembly, configuration, and troubleshooting
- **Safety guidelines** for legal and ethical operation
