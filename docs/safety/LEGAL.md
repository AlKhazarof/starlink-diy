## 🔒 Safety Guidelines

### RF Safety

#### Exposure Limits
Radio frequency energy can be harmful:

**Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE)**:
- **Controlled Environment**: 10 mW/cm² (FCC guidelines)
- **Uncontrolled Environment**: 1 mW/cm²
- Calculate your safe distance based on transmit power

**Protection Measures**:
1. **Never look into an active antenna**
2. Install antennas away from occupied areas
3. Use fencing or barriers around RF equipment
4. Post warning signs
5. Turn off transmitter during maintenance

#### RF Burns
High power RF can cause:
- Thermal burns (internal and external)
- Eye damage
- Implanted device interference (pacemakers, etc.)

**Prevention**:
- De-energize before touching
- Use non-conductive tools
- Maintain safe distances
- Follow lockout/tagout procedures

### Electrical Safety

#### High Voltage
Systems may operate at dangerous voltages:

**Hazards**:
- Lethal shock hazard (>30V can be dangerous)
- Arc flash risk
- Fire hazard

**Safety Practices**:
1. Use properly rated equipment
2. Follow electrical codes (NEC, IEC)
3. Install ground fault protection
4. Use appropriate PPE
5. Never work on live circuits alone

#### Power Supplies
- Use isolated power supplies
- Install fuses and circuit breakers
- Protect against reverse polarity
- Include thermal protection
- Ground all equipment properly

### Mechanical Safety

#### Installation
**Height Safety**:
- Use proper fall protection when working at height
- Secure ladders and scaffolding
- Never work alone at height
- Check weather conditions

**Structural**:
- Ensure adequate structural support
- Account for wind loading
- Use appropriate fasteners
- Consider seismic requirements

#### Moving Parts
- Guard rotating components
- Include emergency stops
- Post warning labels
- Prevent unexpected operation

### Weather Considerations

**Lightning Protection**:
- Install lightning arrestors
- Ground all equipment
- Disconnect during storms
- Follow NFPA 780 guidelines

**Environmental**:
- Weatherproof all outdoor equipment
- Account for temperature extremes
- Protect from moisture and corrosion
- Consider ice loading

## 🚨 Emergency Procedures

5. Review safety procedures

### Electrical Shock
1. DO NOT TOUCH the victim if still in contact
2. Disconnect power source
3. Call emergency services
4. Provide first aid if trained
5. Document incident

### Equipment Failure
1. Disable affected systems
2. Assess safety risks
3. Secure area if necessary
4. Document failure mode
5. Investigate root cause
